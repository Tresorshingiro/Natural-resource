 * This portal carries three modules: climate; conservation, which was moved in
 * from its own split portal; and climate change adaptation. The first two run
 * on GeoHub, so they share one sign-in and one access server. Adaptation's
 * applications live on the Ministry of Environment's Enterprise instead — see
 * its entry.
 *
 * The shape is unchanged from the parent — same fields, same guard — so a
 * module can be moved back or across without touching any component.

     * Applications, and the groups they hang under.
     *
     * An entry with `apps` instead of `url` is a GROUP: a label carrying
     * dashboards, not something that opens. Both entries here were one
     * Experience Builder app whose own tab bar led to the pages listed under
     * it, so the frame showed a landing page the user then had to navigate a
     * second time. The pages are listed here instead and open directly, under a
     * group named for the app they came from:
     *
     *   Protected Area Mapping and Monitoring — experience 935a93ef…
     *   Biodiversity Mapping                  — experience 3ab8b6b4…
     *
     * The order is each app's own tab order. Leaves keep the exact shape they
     * always had — name, url, year — so an application can still be moved
     * between portals untouched.
     *
     * `form` is the Survey123 form that FEEDS that dashboard — the data entry
     * side of the same activity, which is why it hangs off the dashboard rather
     * than sitting beside it. Its name is free-form; check-data.mjs only
     * requires that it differ from the dashboard's own. The URL is the share
     * link as Survey123 gives it;
     * formEmbedUrl() serves it through /api/forms and points `portalUrl` at this
     * origin's portal proxy, so the layer the form submits to gets the session
     * token. `portalUrl` must still be here — check-data.mjs requires it, and it
     * records which Enterprise the form belongs to.
